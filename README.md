# UniqueHaplotypeTestCAD

UniqueHaplotypeTestCAD is a version of GeneCausalityTest for coronary artery disease that resolves local haplotype structure and averages on samples with unique haplotype structure. The script improves correlations made by GeneCausalityTest for defining causality of a gene for CAD, especially in the local regions of strong linkage disequilibrium. The script outputs the directionality of expression change with the increasing number of risk SNPs and uses CAD GWAS data (Nelson et al.) and HCASMC eQTL data for regression analysis.
